## Creating a Pull Request
Remember to create a branch before start developing! It's name should contain the issue id and a slug to tell what the thing you're working on is about, for example: `1337-lorem-ipsum`

If you haven't yet contributed to a project on GitHub, or aren't still sure what the workflow looks like, read the documentation about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). You may also wish to download the GitHub application ([Mac](https://mac.github.com) | [Windows](https://windows.github.com), which simplifies the workflow a bit and provides a nice GUI for your contributions).
