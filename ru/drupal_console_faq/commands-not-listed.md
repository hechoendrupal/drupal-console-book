# Commands not listed
This document is a work-in-progress. At any time, it is possible that the Drupal Console project is ahead of the documentation. While we endeavor to keep this book up-to-date, it is always possible that some commands have been created for the Drupal Console, but are not yet described in this document. For a full list of supported commands, use the **list** command, e.g. `$ drupal list`

If you see a command that is not yet described here, you are also welcome to [contribute to this documentation](../contribute_to_drupal_console/contribute-to-the-drupal-console-book.md "Contribute to the Drupal Console documentation"), using the **--help** output for the command as a simple starting point.
